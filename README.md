1.TRIVIA.PY
This python program is designed to host a sitcom trivia game for the player. This game consists of two rounds each consisting of multiple choice questions. A player scores a point for giving correct answer and loses a point for every incorrect answer.Also, the player is given the choice to skip the question. 
A player is also given a chance to flip the question in round 1. A player has the lifelines of either flipping a question or removing two incorrect options in the second round. The instructions have been carefully mentioned in the program as the game begins. This is my first project after learning python, I hope you enjoy it. 
The idea for this project comes solely from the love of sitcoms since they help me relax when in stress. So, enjoy this game. 
From one sitcom lover to another!!:)

2.TOWERS_OF_HANOI.PY
This python program is designed to host the popular game of towers of hanoi by making use of data structure called stacks.Hope you like it;))
The Tower of Hanoi (also called The problem of Benares Temple[1] or Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[2] and sometimes pluralized as Towers, or simply pyramid puzzle[3]) is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:
1.Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2.Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3.No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
