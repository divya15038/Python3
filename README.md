1.TRIVIA.PY
This python program is designed to host a sitcom trivia game for the player. This game consists of two rounds each consisting of multiple choice questions. A player scores a point for giving correct answer and loses a point for every incorrect answer.Also, the player is given the choice to skip the question. 
A player is also given a chance to flip the question in round 1. A player has the lifelines of either flipping a question or removing two incorrect options in the second round. The instructions have been carefully mentioned in the program as the game begins. This is my first project after learning python, I hope you enjoy it. 
The idea for this project comes solely from the love of sitcoms since they help me relax when in stress. So, enjoy this game. 
From one sitcom lover to another!!:)
